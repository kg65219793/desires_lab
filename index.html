<h1>DESIRES Lab @ Peking University</h1>
</div>
<p>DEciSion, computIng, eneRgy, and Economic Systems (DESIRES) Lab is directed by Prof. Pengcheng You at the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, College of Engineering, Peking University. 
We work in the intersection of engineering and economics, with a focus on analysis and design for real-world systems with provable performance.
The current research interests include multi-timescale market design for electricity markets/online platforms, control/economics of distributed energy resources in smart grids, and optimization/reinforcement learning algorithms.</p>
